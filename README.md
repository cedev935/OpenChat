# üî• OpenChat

**Important disclaimer:** This is an undergoing efforts to create a free & open source chatbot console that allows you to easily create unlimited chatbots using different models for your daily use. Our main goal is to make the interface simple and user-friendly for everyone. If you find this interesting, we would greatly appreciate your support in contributing to this project. We have a highly ambitious plan that we are determined to implement!

---- 
OpenChat is an everyday user chatbot console that simplifies the utilization of large language models. With the advancements in AI, the installation and usage of these models have become overwhelming. OpenChat aims to address this challenge by providing a two-step setup process to create a comprehensive chatbot console. It serves as a central hub for managing multiple customized chatbots.

> Currently, OpenChat supports GPT models, and we are actively working on incorporating various open-source drivers that can be activated with a single click.




## Try it out:
**You can try it out on [openchat.so](http://openchat.so/) (we use our own OpenAI/pinecone token for the demo, please be mindful on the usage, we will clear out bots every 3 hours)**
